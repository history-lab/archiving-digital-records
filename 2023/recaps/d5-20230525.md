# Day 5 Recap - May 26th, 2023
## Doing Digital History
* An excellent book for both archivists and historians to further develop command line and project skills:

## regex & Grep
* exact matching (single string) vs. pattern matching (set of strings)
* regex: regular expression
     * specifies match pattern
     * combines literal & metacharacters
     * e.g., gr(a|e)y matches "gray" or "grey" 
     * complicated regexes are challenging
* grep: "global regular expression print"
    * command-line utility that searches file(s) via regex

## File types and formats
* Text vs. Binary: every file is one or the other
* Text Files
    * uses character encoding such as UTF-8
    * readable in a text editor
    * valid input to command-line tools like grep
    * some text formats: .txt, .html, .xml, .csv
* Binary Files
    * any file that's not a text file
    * some binary formats: .pdf, .docx, .mp3, .tiff, .jpg, .mp3, .zip
* `file <filename>`: bash command that shows file type and format
