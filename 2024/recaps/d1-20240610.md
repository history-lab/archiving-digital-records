# Day 1 Recap - June 10th, 2024
## For tomorrow
* Be prepared to give your lightning talk
## Introduction/orientation/goals
* Active feedback & participation are strongly encouraged!
* Learn more about: 
    - PDFs, 
    - command line 
    - text processing & analytics

## PDF material
* PDF = Portable Document Format
* How many? nobody knows for sure, but almost certainly trillions
* History
    * roots in desktop publishing
    * became the way to distribute paginated documents on the web
    * today - voluminous ISO standard (1000 pgs)
* PDF/A - long-term preservation standard
    * subset of PDF
    * must be self-contained (e.g., include all fonts)
    * must contain specific metadata 
    * preferred or accepted format by NARA and LOC
    * validation and conversion software available

## Group activity
### PDF Attributes & Characteristics we came up with:
* technical & admin metadata 
* integrity checks 
* structured & forms
* packages text, form, and visual objects
* images, links, and scanned documents
* web compatible: can contain links and be accessible on the web
* ISO standard, non-proprietary
* HW/SW/OS interoperable
* accessible
* text searchable
* finalized form, fixed
* preferred format
* durability
* not necessarily WYSWIG
* scalable
* future: concerns about authenticity

### PDF use cases we came up with:
* Equidox 
* Create them from old word processing, sometimes using LibreOffice
* Pull materials from disparate collections into one large PDF
* Combine PDF with metadata and finding aid information
* Batch level redaction, PyMuPDF
* Create archival administrative forms
* More effective sharing - see annotations and ease access

## Command line
* Why bother? increases your ability to get stuff done
* command line = terminal
* enter commands and receive output via text
* shell program
* bash
