# Day 2 Recap - June 11th, 2024
## For tomorrow
**Required**: Read the PDF's association three part series from the PDF Association
   1. [A Technical and Cultural Assessment of the Mueller Report PDF](https://pdfa.org/a-technical-and-cultural-assessment-of-the-mueller-report-pdf/) 2019-04-19
   2. [Even with OCR, the Mueller Report PDF isn't fully searchable](https://pdfa.org/even-with-ocr-the-mueller-report-pdf-isnt-fully-searchable/) 2019-04-20
   3. [DoJ reposts the Mueller Report!](https://pdfa.org/doj-reposts-the-mueller-report/)2019-04-23

Attempt to complete the lab exercises:
   1. Create a new directory at the same directory level as `pdfs` called `txt`. Move `mueller.txt` to your newly created `txt` subdirectory.
   2. How can we ensure output generated from `pdftotext` goes to the `txt` directory in the future?
   3. Test some flags on both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. Find anything interesting?
   4. Load another PDF into codespace - something that interests you. Run both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. How's the text quality? 

Optional: If you'd like to try some more exercises, here are a few from lab 1 that we skipped over:
   1. List all the files in the `archiving-digital-records` directory and its subdirectories.
   2. List all the markdown files in `archiving-digital-records/2024` beginning with the number 0.
   3. Repeat (2) but in a long format ordered by their last modification.

## What we covered on Day 2:
### GitHub Codespaces Overview
Create and how to use
### Command line lab 1
#### Commands:
- ps: display running processes
- git clone: make a copy of a current repository
- pwd: present working directory
- ls: list directory contents 
- cd: change directory
- cat: concatenate and print files
- less: display file
#### Command flags (options):
- enables/disables a feature
- `ls -l` list files in long (extended) format
- `-l` is a command flag
#### Command argument:
- specifies the target of the command (e.g., file) 
- `less 08-command-line-lab-1.md` display file 
- `08-command-line-lab-1.md` is the argument
#### Figuring out how a command works:
- chatGpt, Google, ask somebody
- on the command line: `man <command-name>`
```
man ps
```  
### Command line lab 2
- mkdir: creates a new directory
- curl:  download files and webpages (`c`lient for `url`s)
```
curl -o mueller.pdf https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download
```
- install pdf utilities called poppler-utils
    * pdfinfo – list all information of a PDF
    * pdftotext – extract all text from PDF
    * others
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppler_(software)#poppler-utils
### Lightning Talks
Some excellent talks from participants:
* Rachel: UCSF Industry Document Library, https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/
* Riva: The Programming Historian, https://programminghistorian.org/
* Irina: Equidox - PDF Accessibility, https://equidox.co/
* Amelia: What's a file? https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3610221

Participants are encouraged to post their slide decks in our Slack channel!

We will continue with lightning talks in the afternoon of Day 3.
