# Introduction to the command line
---
<!-- _class: lead -->
# A course objective:
## To get comfortable on the command line
### But why?
---
# Reasons to learn the command line
* Access to software that is only available on the command line
* Gain access to powerful capabilities:
     * process N files as easily as one
     * run a sequence of programs as easily as one
     * redirect the output from one program to use as input to another
* High return on time invested
* Pre-req for productive programming

# OK, what is the command line?
* Textual interface to the computer
* The user inputs commands via keyboard and receives text output
* "command line" and "terminal" are used interchangeably

# Bash
* Many command line [shell programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)
* Most are very similar and provide a command (aka scripting) language
* We're using `bash` (Bourne Again SHell)
   * most popular shell
   * available on Windows/Mac/Linux

# Your laptop and the command line
* You can access the command line on your laptop
* Differences (typically minor) across platforms and versions
* Different notebooks: different memory, disk space, SW versions
* Leads to a high chance of idiosyncratic issues arising 
* Impairs the initial learning experience
---
# GitHub Codespaces for the exercises
* Eliminates issues described on the previous slide 
* Everybody gets an individual but identical environment
* Don't need to install SW on laptop
* Get exposure to GitHub and cloud computing
* Gateway to further training with [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/hands-on-practice-with-github-codespaces)
* Free for up to forty hours a month
* Friday, you'll get a chance to install the tools on your notebook

* (Optional) If you haven't already signed up for access to one of:
    * chatGPT
    * Google Gemini
    * Microsoft Edge Copilot
