1. Create a new directory at the same directory level as `pdfs` called `txt`. Move `mueller.txt` to your newly created `txt` subdirectory.

2. How can we ensure output generated from `pdftotext` goes to the `txt` directory in the future?

3. Test some flags on both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. Find anything interesting?

4. Load another PDF into codespace - something that interests you. Run both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. How's the text quality?
