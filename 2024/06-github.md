# So, what is GitHub?
In addition to Codespaces, which is a relatively new and small part of GitHub - 
* **Original and primary function:**  platform for storing, distributing, collaborating on, and deploying code
* Developer-oriented social media network
* [Website Hosting](https://pages.github.com/)
