# Getting started with GitHub Codespaces (and GitHub)
---
<!-- _class: lead -->
# A course objective:
## To get comfortable on the command line
---
# Why not use our notebooks?
* You can access the command line on your notebook
* But it's a bit different on Windows/Mac/Linux
    * differences have decreased over the years
    * but still exist, even across different OS versions
* Different notebooks: different memory, disk space, SW
* Friction impairs the initial learning experience
---
# Why GitHub Codespaces?
* Solves friction problem
* Everybody gets an individual but identical environment
* Don't need to install SW on notebook
* Get exposure to GitHub and cloud computing
* Gateway to further training with [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/hands-on-practice-with-github-codespaces)

# What is GitHub Codespaces?
A cloud-based software development environment
### Alternate definition for our workshop -
Your own virtual computer running in the cloud with a browser-based interface consisting of:
* a command line (terminal) 
* an editor
* a file system

# Codespaces Visual - Key
1. file system view (side bar)
2. toggle filespace (activity bar)
3. editor
4. command line/terminal (panels)
5. status bar
---
# Codespace Requirements
* GitHub account
* Codespace is free for personal accounts with up to 15 GB storage and 120 processor hours
    * shuts down automatically after a period of disuse
* On Friday, we'll visit configuring your notebook for the tools you want
---
# So what is GitHub?
In addition to Codespaces, which is a fairly new and small part of GitHub - 
* **Original and main function:**  platform for storing, distributing, collaborating on, and deploying code
* Developer-oriented social media network
* [Website Hosting](https://pages.github.com/)
* [GitHub Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc) - they try to explain themselves
---
# And Git?
* Open-source version control software
* Predates GitHub and not initially developed by them
* But without Git, there would be no GitHub
