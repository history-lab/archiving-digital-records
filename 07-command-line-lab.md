# Understanding what we just did
* `git` tracks collections of files, usually project related
* repo (aka repository): collection of files under git control
* repo contains the latest version of files, but also all previous versons
* `clone` a git command that you can think of as a copy command + tracking info

# Navigating the filesystem using Explorer & Editor
1. Click on `06-command-line-101.md`
2. Review the "code" for the slide
3. Click on `Open Preview for the Slide` - RHS of editor window
4. Control (right) click on a filename to see actions
---
# pwd & ls commands
1. Note that terminal's current working directory is part of the command line prompt
    * use can also use the `pwd` command to see it

# Commands in general
* commands = programs
* built-in and user defined
* Unix (and Linux) origins
* flags and arguments
---
# Command flag
* example: `-l` in `ls -l` 
* modify default command behavior
* begins with a `-`
* sometimes called option
   * esp. if it accepts arguments
---
# Command argument
* exammple: `README.md` in `ls -l README.md` 
* modifies default command behavior
* sometimes called option
   * esp. if it accepts arguments
---
# Learning more about a command
* man command (e.g. `man ls`)
* Google
* chatGPT and variants

# Changing directories
* pwd: present (i.e., current) working directory
*  `cd archiving-digital-records` change pwd to named directory
*  `cd -` change pwd to previous directory

---
# Viewing files
* `cat README.md`
* `less 06-command-line-101.md`
    * Use less for bigger files
    * Navigation options: <return>, <space>, b, h
    * Use `man less` if you forget
---
# Creating a directory
* Create a directory for the PDFs we are going to experiment on
* `mkdir pdfs`
* `cd pdfs`
---
# Downloading a file from the internet
* The curl command lets you fetch a given URL or file

* "client for URLs"

* software installs typically require a privilaged account
---
# Understanding software installs `apt-get`
* software installer
* accepts subcommands such as:
     * `update`  update the package lists for available software packages 
     * `install` install or upgrade packages
---
# What is `poppler-utils`?
* name of the software packaged we are installing 
* a set of command-line programs for processing PDFs
* we will intially focus on two:
    * `pdfinfo`
    * `pdftotext` 
---
# `pdfinfo` 
* Shows a PDF's metadata
* From your `pdfs` subdirectory enter the following at the command line and press return:

# `pdftotext`
* Extracts text from a PDF
* From your pdfs subdirectory enter the following at the command line and press return:
`pdftotext mueller.pdf`
* Try `ls`

---
# Exercises
1. Create a new directory at the same directory level as `pdfs` called `txt`. Move `mueller.txt` to your newly created `txt` subdirectory.

2. How can we ensure output generated from `pdftotext` goes to the `txt` directory going forward?

3. Test out some of the flags on both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. Try to find something worth discussing.

4. Load another PDF into codespace - something that interests you. Run both `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext`. How's the text quality?
