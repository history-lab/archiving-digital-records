# Your computer and the command line
* You can access the command line on your notebook
* But it's a bit different on Windows/Mac/Linux
    * differences have decreased over the years
    * but still exist, even across different versions of the same OS
* Different notebooks: different memory, disk space, SW versions
* Good chance of idiosyncratic issues arising
* Impairs the initial learning experience

* Eliminates problem descibed on the previous slide 
* Everybody gets an individual but identical environment
* Don't need to install SW on notebook
* Get exposure to GitHub and cloud computing
