## Review of PDF Association posts on the Mueller Report PDF
Highlights:
* PDFs of born-digital documents can vary significantly in their information richness - from superb to not useful without additional processing!
* No-nos
     * Scanning a born-digital document
          * Loss of searchable text
             * OCR won't yield text with complete fidelity
          * Bigger file size
     * Not including metadata
     * Don't redact from a scan
     * Not generating PDF/A for a historically significant document
     * Not generating PDF/UA - an accessible version for the visually impaired (as required by law in this case)
     * Need to QA - if automatically adding links
* redact-release workflow: feasible with modern software instead of
    * redact-print-scan-release
    * print-scan-OCR-redact-print-scan-release

## Follow-ups
